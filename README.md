# Introduction

In recent years, crowdfunding has become very prevalent, especially for aspiring entrepreneurs who are hoping to raise money for their projects. Crowdfunding allows people and organizations to raise money for their projects, while also allowing donors to support the causes that they believe in. Kickstarter is one of the largest and most notable crowdfunding platforms. In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset about Kickstarter projects to explore the different types of crowdfunding projects. We would like to see if some projects are more likely to succeed than other projects, based on the characteristics of those projects and the creators of the projects. Moreover, we would like to gain insight on the behaviors of project backers.
